**Keeping an Eye on your IoT**

How to bolt on a network accessible camera to your low power low bandwidth IoT project.


*A Use Case*

So you've created a prototype of your low power low bandwidth IoT project but
find that it glitches once in a while. We'll cover how to temporarily bolt on a power
and bandwidth hungry Raspberry Pi with camera to help monitor and hopefully
resolve the problem. Perhaps enhanced and use the rig for future projects.


*Outline*

1. Present primary IoT use case - temporary addition for monitoring
2. Basic network camera setup
3. Motion (open source software) vs Python program option
4. Securing upload using OpenSSL and Docker containers
5. Synchronizing images and IoT sensor data (from MQTT topics)
6. Remotely trigger On/Off camera via MQTT
7. Future use case - vision processing, ML?
8. Q&A


*Artifacts*

1. Shell Scripts
2. Python Code
3. Docker container spec
4. Docs
5. Pics?
