**Keeping an Eye on you IoT**

How to bolt on a network accessible camera to your low power low bandwidth IoT project.


*A Use Case*

So you've created a protype of your low power low bandwidth IoT project but
find that it glitches once in a while. We'll cover how to bolt on a power
and bandwidth Raspberry Pi with camera to resolve the problem, and perhaps
enhanced the rig for future projects.


*Outline*

1. Present use cases - temporary rig addition
2. Basic network camera setup
3. Motion (open source software) vs Python program option
4. Securing upload using OpenSSL and Docker containers
5. Synchronizing images and IoT sensor data (from MQTT topics)
6. Future use case - vision processing
7. Q&A


*Artifacts*

1. Shell Scripts
2. Python Code
3. Docker container spec
